# What is this?

This is **ogybot.** a discord bot made by me for misc features relating a discord server I'm in.

The bot is 100% developed by me and uses a few technologies, such as:

- C#(.NET)
- Entity Framework Core
- MySQL
- Discord.NET

As this project's been maintained for a while now (created on June 25, 2024), it'
 also pretty fun to see my programming evolution, both in C# and overall.

## TODO's:

- Add dependency injection and refactor code accordingly
- Make an appsettings.json file to store persistent info such as bot branch, guild IDs, connection strings, etc
- Refactor commands for cleaner code
